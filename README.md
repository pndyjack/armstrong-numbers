# Armstrong Numbers

An [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

- 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`
- 10 is _not_ an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`
- 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`
- 154 is _not_ an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`

Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```
